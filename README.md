# RISC-V Simulator

This **RISC-V Simulator** is designed to execute assembly programs using a **multi-core architecture**. It supports **4 cores**, each with its own dedicated **1KB memory segment**. The simulator reads assembly instructions from a file, processes them, and executes them sequentially.  
## KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM IMPLEMENTED PHASE 2
### 1.How It Works:
1. Provides an option to enable or disable data forwarding.
2. Parses the entire `assembly.asm` file, storing the contents of the .data section and labels.
3. Asks for the number of ALU instructions with variable latencies.
4. Instructions are **case-sensitive**.
5. Executes the program and displays:
          1. Clock cycles
          2.  Stalls
          3. IPC (Instructions Per Cycle) for each core
          4.  Final 4KB memory state

### 2. Assumptions:
1.  Due to the lack of certain details, the following assumptions are made:
#### Data Dependency Handling:
* If a data dependency occurs in memory instructions (lw or sw), the pipeline stalls.
* The dependent instruction receives data from the MEM/WB stage of the memory instruction.
#### Program Counter (PC) & Fetch Unit Behavior:
* The CID mechanism described in the specification suggests that each core may skip certain instructions.
* Each core maintains a separate PC, as a single fetch unit cannot fetch different instructions for different cores simultaneously.
* The fetch unit executes once per cycle but fetches for all four cores.
#### Array Sum Example Execution:
* Each core calculates a partial sum, storing it in its allocated memory segment.
* Core 1 executes sum_loop to compute the final sum.
* The sample assembly code used for testing is attached.
## Implemented RISC-V Instructions
The following **RISC-V instructions** are implemented in our simulator:
### 1. Arithmetic Instructions
- `add` - Adds two registers.
- `sub` - Subtracts two registers.
- `mul` - Multiplies two registers.
- `addi` - Adds an immediate value to a register.
- `slli` - Shifts a register left by an immediate value.
- `and` - r1&r2
- `or` - r1 || r2
- `xor` - r1 ^r2

### 2. Branch and Jump Instructions
- `bne` - Branch if registers are not equal along with the core specific branch conditions (i.e CID).
- `blt` - Branch if one register is less than another.
- `beq` - Branch if registers are equal along with the core specific branch conditions (i.e CID).
- `jal` - Jump and link (function call).
- `j` - Unconditional jump.

### 3. Memory Access Instructions
- `lw` - Load word (loads from memory into a register).
- `sw` - Store word (stores a register value into memory).

### 4. Data Transfer Instructions
- `li` - Load an immediate value into a register.
- `la` - Load the address of a label into a register.

### 5. System Call Instruction
- `ecall` - Used for system exit (if register `x17 == 10`, program terminates).

### 6. No-Operation Instruction
- `nop` - Does nothing (used for alignment or delays).

## Bubble Sort Implementation
To demonstrate the functionality of our simulator, we have provided an **assembly file (`assembly.asm`)** containing **Bubble Sort**. This program sorts an array using the **implemented RISC-V instructions** and executes it within the simulator using the intructions in it.

After execution, the simulator prints the final register values and memory contents. ðŸš€

## Minutes of Meeting 
# RISC-V Simulator Development (PHASE - 2)
---
## **10th March**
**DESIGN DECISION**:Realised the single fetch unit would not work , reason is written in the key take away.
- **Saranya:** Implemented the fetch in a different way handling the CID condition , tested the array sum and fixed the bugs .
- **Binnu:** Adapted branch and jump instructions to accommodate the new single fetch unit, ensuring proper instruction fetching across all cores.

## **9th March**
- **Saranya:** Started implementing the single fetch unit for all the compute units along with the given CID condition .
- **Binnu:** Adapted branch and jump instructions to accommodate the new single fetch unit, ensuring proper instruction fetching across all cores.

## **7th - 8th March**
- **Saranya:**
       1. Attempted to implement Bubble Sort, but encountered errors in memory dependencies and corrected the data dependencies on memory instructions.
       2. Fixed the errors in varaible latenices like : values getting lost after the nth execution of the the instruction.
- **Binnu:** Experimented with different `.asm` files and verified clock cycle correctness to ensure accurate instruction execution.

 ## **5th March**
- **Saranya:** Implemented variable latencies and introduced user input functionality. Due to design changes, stalls couldn't be implemented yet.
- **Binnu:**  Implemented the shift stages function and enabled stalls within it, providing better hazard handling.

## **3rd March**
- **Saranya:** Re-enabled data forwarding after design modifications to optimize instruction flow.
- **Binnu:** Continued fixing bugs to ensure correct execution and data propagation.

## **2nd March**
**DESIGN DECISION**:The initial design assigned registers to each stage, which did not allow data forwarding to function smoothly. To address this, the registers were changed to pipeline registers that are shared between two stages, enabling efficient data forwarding.
- **Saranya:** Realized the initial pipeline design had fundamental flaws and restructured it to have a dedicated pipeline for each stage.
- **Binnu:** Conducted thorough checks on data dependencies to refine pipeline execution.

## **1st March**
- **Saranya:** Integrated data forwarding to minimize stalls and improve performance.
- **Binnu:** Debugging and refining the implementation to ensure correctness and stability.

## **28th February**
- **Saranya:** Initially implemented registers for each stage in the pipeline.
- **Binnu:** Implemented stalls to handle pipeline hazards, ensuring smooth execution flow.

## Conclusion
Significant progress has been made in refining the RISC-V simulator, from pipeline structuring to advanced optimizations like data forwarding, variable latencies, and hazard handling. With ongoing debugging and refinements, the project is steadily progressing toward a more robust and efficient simulation model.

# RISC-V Simulator Development (PHASE - 1) 

## **February 20**  
### **Final Fixes:**  
âœ… Implemented all required instructions.  
âœ… Loops executed correctly.  

#### **Saranya (Final Fixes):**  
- **Problem in memory allocation of cores:** All cores accessed the same memory.  
- A basic swap function swapped the elements in the same address 4 times (took time to debug; initially thought it was an `sw` function error).
- **Major Issue Fixed:**  
- Memory allocation for cores was incorrectâ€”each core accessed the same memory, causing `sw` to overwrite the same address multiple times.  
- Initially assumed this was an `sw` function error but later discovered the issue was due to improper memory segmentation.  
- **Solution:** Implemented another structure called core memory and allocated distinct memory sections for each core.  
#### **Binnu:**  
- Compiled all the progress and key fixes into a structured **README file** for documentation.  

- âœ… **Final Outcome:** The bubble sort program executed successfully!  

## **February 19**  
### **Challenges Faced:**  

#### **Saranya (Simulator - Branch Instruction & PC Interaction):**  
- `.data` was successfully stored, but the code didnâ€™t execute correctly.  
- After extensive debugging, found that **branch instructions** were not working properly.  
- Adjusted **instruction execution** and **PC increments** accordingly.  

#### **Binnu (Simulator):**  
- **Jump instructions** were not working properly, causing infinite loops.  
- Fixed the issue and successfully executed basic loops.  

**Conclusion:** Bubble sort still did not work.  

## **February 18**  
### **Decisions:**  

#### **Saranya (Simulator & Memory-Simulator Interaction):**  
- Updated parsing logic to read `.data`, `.text`, and `.word` sections from an assembly file.  
- Faced an issue where `.data` parsing failed because values were **not separated by commas**, leading to debugging delays.  
- Changed a data structure from `set` to `unordered_map`, which **broke the code**, requiring extensive debugging and partial rewrites.  

#### **Binnu (Simulator):**  
- Implemented additional instructions (`la`, `li`, `slli`, etc.) required for the **bubble sort program**.  

## **February 17**  
### **Decisions:**  

#### **Saranya (Simulator):**  
- Modified input handling to **read from a file** instead of terminal commands (`parseAssembly` function).  
- Commands did not work initially; **adjusted input structure** for each command.  

#### **Binnu (Simulator):**  
- Implemented **`lw` and `sw`** instructions and integrated memory access functions.  

#### **Binnu (Core & Memory):**  
- Added debugging commands (`print registers`, `print memory`) to **verify `lw` and `sw` operations**.  

## **February 15**  
### **Decisions:**  

- **Split** `main.cpp` into three separate files:  
  - `core.cpp` - Handles core attributes like `core_id`, **program counter (PC)**, and **registers**.  
  - `memory.cpp` - Manages **memory allocation per core**, including `lw` and `sw` functions.  
  - `simulator.cpp` - Implements **basic RISC-V instructions** (`add`, `sub`, `bne`, `jal`) and reads instructions from **terminal input**.  

#### **Responsibilities:**  
- **Binnu:** Worked on `core.cpp` and `memory.cpp`.  
- **Saranya:** Worked on the **simulator's basic functionality**.  


## **February 14**  
### **Decisions:**  
- **Finalized** C++ as the programming language for development.  
- Wrote a **basic C++ program** combining **core and memory functionality** in a single file.  
- **Saranya** worked on this initial structure.
