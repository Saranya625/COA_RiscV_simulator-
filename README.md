# Minutes of Meeting - RISC-V Simulator Development  

## **February 20**  
### **Final Fixes:**  
âœ… Implemented all required instructions.  
âœ… Loops executed correctly.  

#### **Saranya (Final Fixes):**  
- **Problem in memory allocation of cores:** All cores accessed the same memory.  
- A basic swap function swapped the elements in the same address 4 times (took time to debug; initially thought it was an `sw` function error).  

#### **Major Issue Fixed:**  
- Memory allocation for cores was incorrectâ€”each core accessed the same memory, causing `sw` to overwrite the same address multiple times.  
- Initially assumed this was an `sw` function error but later discovered the issue was due to improper memory segmentation.  
- **Solution:** Implemented another structure called core memory and allocated distinct memory sections for each core.  
- âœ… **Final Outcome:** The bubble sort program executed successfully!

### **Challenges Faced:**  

#### **Saranya (Simulator - Branch Instruction & PC Interaction):**  
- `.data` was successfully stored, but the code didnâ€™t execute correctly.  
- After extensive debugging, found that **branch instructions** were not working properly.  
- Adjusted **instruction execution** and **PC increments** accordingly.  

#### **Binnu (Simulator):**  
- **Jump instructions** were not working properly, causing infinite loops.  
- Fixed the issue and successfully executed basic loops.  

**Conclusion:** Bubble sort still did not work.

## **February 18**  
### **Decisions:**  

#### **Saranya (Simulator & Memory-Simulator Interaction):**  
- Updated parsing logic to read `.data`, `.text`, and `.word` sections from an assembly file.  
- Faced an issue where `.data` parsing failed because values were **not separated by commas**, leading to debugging delays.  
- Changed a data structure from `set` to `unordered_map`, which **broke the code**, requiring extensive debugging and partial rewrites.  

#### **Binnu (Simulator):**  
- Implemented additional instructions (`la`, `li`, `slli`, etc.) required for the **bubble sort program**.

## **February 17**  
### **Decisions:**  

#### **Saranya (Simulator):**  
- Modified input handling to **read from a file** instead of terminal commands (`parseAssembly` function).  
- Commands did not work initially; **adjusted input structure** for each command.  

#### **Binnu (Simulator):**  
- Implemented **`lw` and `sw`** instructions and integrated memory access functions.  

#### **Binnu (Core & Memory):**  
- Added debugging commands (`print registers`, `print memory`) to **verify `lw` and `sw` operations**.

## **February 15**  
### **Decisions:**  

- **Split** `main.cpp` into three separate files:  
  - `core.cpp` - Handles core attributes like `core_id`, **program counter (PC)**, and **registers**.  
  - `memory.cpp` - Manages **memory allocation per core**, including `lw` and `sw` functions.  
  - `simulator.cpp` - Implements **basic RISC-V instructions** (`add`, `sub`, `bne`, `jal`) and reads instructions from **terminal input**.  

#### **Responsibilities:**  
- **Binnu:** Worked on `core.cpp` and `memory.cpp`.  
- **Saranya:** Worked on the **simulator's basic functionality**.

## **February 14**  
### **Decisions:**  
- **Finalized** C++ as the programming language for development.  
- Wrote a **basic C++ program** combining **core and memory functionality** in a single file.  
- **Saranya** worked on this initial structure.
